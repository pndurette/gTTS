-   Added Hebrew language support ([\#324](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/324))
-   Added new `gTTS.stream()` method to stream bytes ([\#319](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/319))

### Misc

2.2.3 (2021-06-17)
------------------

### Features

-   Added Bulgarian language support ([\#302](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/302))

2.2.2 (2021-02-03)
------------------

### Features

-   Adds a language fallback feature for deprecated languages to
    maintain compatiblity (e.g. `en-us` becomes `en`). Fallback can be
    disabled with `lang_check=False` or `--nocheck` for the cli ([\#267](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/267))

### Bugfixes

-   Fix Python 2.7 compatiblity (!). Python 2 is long gone, but the cut
    wasn\'t clearly communicated for gTTS, so it was restored. Python 2
    support will be completely removed in the next major release. ([\#255](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/255))
-   Language code case sensitivity is maintained throughout ([\#267](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/267))

### Deprecations and Removals

-   The following list of \'hyphenated\' language codes no longer work
    and have been removed: `en-us`, `en-ca`, `en-uk`, `en-gb`, `en-au`,
    `en-gh`, `en-in`, `en-ie`, `en-nz`, `en-ng`, `en-ph`, `en-za`,
    `en-tz`, `fr-ca`, `fr-fr`, `pt-br`, `pt-pt`, `es-es`, `es-us`,
    `zh-cn`, `zh-tw` ([\#267](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/267))
-   Removed the `gtts.get_url()` method (outdated since `2.1.0`) ([\#270](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/270))

2.2.1 (2020-11-15)
------------------

### Bugfixes

-   `_package_rpc()` was erroneously packaging the entire text instead
    of tokenized part ([\#252](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/252))

### Improved Documentation

-   Removes reference to automatic retrieval of languages ([\#250](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/250))

### Misc

-   [\#251](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/251)

2.2.0 (2020-11-14)
------------------

### Features

-   Switch to the newer Google TTS API (thanks to[@Boudewijn26!](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/pull/244)). See [his great writeup](https://github.com/Boudewijn26/gTTS-token/blob/master/docs/november-2020-translate-changes.md) for more on the methodology and why this was necessary. ([\#226](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/226), [#232](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/232), [\#236](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/236), [\#241](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/241))

### Deprecations and Removals

-   Removed automatic language download from the main code, which has
    become too unreliable & slow. Languages will still be fetched but a
    pre-generated list will be shipped with `gTTS`. ([\#233](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/233), [\#241](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/241), [\#242](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/242), [\#243](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/243))
-   Because languages are now pre-generated, removed custom TLD support
    for language URL (which allowed to get language **names** in other
    than English) ([\#245](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/245))

### Misc

-   [\#245](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/245)

2.1.2 (2020-11-10)
------------------

### Features

-   Update `gTTS-token` to `1.1.4` ([\#238](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/238))

### Bugfixes

-   Fixed an issue where some tokens could be empty after minimization ([\#229](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/229), [\#239](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/239))

### Improved Documentation

-   Grammar, spelling and example fixes ([\#227](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/227))

### Misc

-   [\#218](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/218), [\#230](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/230), [\#231](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/231), [\#239](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/239)

2.1.1 (2020-01-25)
------------------

### Bugfixes

-   Debug mode now uses a copy of locals() to prevent RuntimeError ([\#213](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/213))

2.1.0 (2020-01-01)
------------------

### Features

-   The `gtts` module
    -   Added the ability to customize the Google Translate URL
        hostname. This is useful when `google.com` might be blocked
        within a network but a local or different Google host (e.g.
        `google.cn`) is not ([\#143](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/143), [\#203](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/203)):
        -   New `gTTS()` parameter `tld` to specify the top-level domain
            to use for the Google hostname, i.e
            `https://translate.google.<tld>` (default: `com`).
        -   Languages are also now fetched using the same customized
            hostname.
    -   Pre-generated TTS API request URLs can now be obtained instead
        of writing an `mp3` file to disk (for example to be used in an
        external program):
        -   New `get_urls()` method returns the list of URLs generated
            by `gTTS`, which can be used in lieu of `write_to_fp()` or
            `save()`.
-   The `gtts-cli` command-line tool
    -   New `--tld` option to match the new `gtts` customizable hostname [\#200](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/200), [#207](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/207))
-   Other
    -   Added Python 3.8 support ([\#204](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/204))

### Bugfixes

-   Changed default word-for-word pre-processor (`('M.', 'Monsieur')`)
    which would substitute any \'m.\' for \'monsieur\' (e.g. \'them.\'
    became \'themonsieur\') ([\#197](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/197))

### Improved Documentation

-   Added examples for newer features ([\#205](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/205), [\#207](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/207))

### Misc

-   [\#204](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/204), [\#205](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/205), [\#207](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/207)

2.0.4 (2019-08-29)
------------------

### Features

-   gTTS is now built as a wheel package (Python 2 & 3) ([\#181](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/181))

### Improved Documentation

-   Fixed bad example in docs ([\#163](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/163), [\#166](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/166))

### Misc

-   [\#164](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/164), [\#171](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/171), [\#173](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/173), [\#185](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/185)

2.0.3 (2018-12-15)
------------------

### Features

-   Added new tokenizer case for \':\' preventing cut in the middle of a
    time notation ([\#135](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/135))

### Misc

-   [\#159](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/159)

2.0.2 (2018-12-09)
------------------

### Features

-   Added Python 3.7 support, modernization of packaging, testing and CI ([\#126](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/126))

### Bugfixes

-   Fixed language retrieval/validation broken from new Google Translate
    page ([\#156](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/156))

2.0.1 (2018-06-20)
------------------

### Bugfixes

-   Fixed an UnicodeDecodeError when installing gTTS if system locale
    was not utf-8 ([\#120](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/120))

### Improved Documentation

-   Added *Pre-processing and tokenizing \> Minimizing* section about
    the API\'s 100 characters limit and how larger tokens are handled ([\#121](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/121))

### Misc

-   [\#122](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/122)

2.0.0 (2018-04-30)
------------------

([\#108](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/108))

### Features

-   The `gtts` module
    -   New logger (\"gtts\") replaces all occurrences of `print()`
    -   Languages list is now obtained automatically (`gtts.lang`) ([\#91](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/91), [#94](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/94), [\#106](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/106))
    -   Added a curated list of language sub-tags that have been
        observed to provide different dialects or accents (e.g.
        \"en-gb\", \"fr-ca\")
    -   New `gTTS()` parameter `lang_check` to disable language
        checking.
    -   `gTTS()` now delegates the `text` tokenizing to the API request
        methods (i.e. `write_to_fp()`, `save()`), allowing `gTTS`
        instances to be modified/reused
    -   Rewrote tokenizing and added pre-processing (see below)
    -   New `gTTS()` parameters `pre_processor_funcs` and
        `tokenizer_func` to configure pre-processing and tokenizing (or
        use a 3rd party tokenizer)
    -   Error handling:
        -   Added new exception `gTTSError` raised on API request
            errors. It attempts to guess what went wrong based on known
            information and observed behaviour ([\#60](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/60), [\#106](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/106))
        -   `gTTS.write_to_fp()` and `gTTS.save()` also raise
            `gTTSError` on [gtts\_token]{.title-ref} error
        -   `gTTS.write_to_fp()` raises `TypeError` when `fp` is not a
            file-like object or one that doesn\'t take bytes
        -   `gTTS()` raises `ValueError` on unsupported languages (and
            `lang_check` is `True`)
        -   More fine-grained error handling throughout (e.g. [request
            failed]{.title-ref} vs. [request successful with a bad
            response]{.title-ref})
-   Tokenizer (and new pre-processors):
    -   Rewrote and greatly expanded tokenizer (`gtts.tokenizer`)
    -   Smarter token \'cleaning\' that will remove tokens that only
        contain characters that can\'t be spoken (i.e. punctuation and
        whitespace)
    -   Decoupled token minimizing from tokenizing, making the latter
        usable in other contexts
    -   New flexible speech-centric text pre-processing
    -   New flexible full-featured regex-based tokenizer
        (`gtts.tokenizer.core.Tokenizer`)
    -   New `RegexBuilder`, `PreProcessorRegex` and `PreProcessorSub`
        classes to make writing regex-powered text
        [pre-processors]{.title-ref} and [tokenizer cases]{.title-ref}
        easier
    -   Pre-processors:
        -   Re-form words cut by end-of-line hyphens
        -   Remove periods after a (customizable) list of known
            abbreviations (e.g. \"jr\", \"sr\", \"dr\") that can be
            spoken the same without a period
        -   Perform speech corrections by doing word-for-word
            replacements from a (customizable) list of tuples
    -   Tokenizing:
        -   Keep punctuation that modify the inflection of speech (e.g.
            \"?\", \"!\")
        -   Don\'t split in the middle of numbers (e.g. \"10.5\",
            \"20,000,000\") ([\#101](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/101))
        -   Don\'t split on \"dotted\" abbreviations and accronyms (e.g.
            \"U.S.A\")
        -   Added Chinese comma (\"，\"), ellipsis (\"...\") to
            punctuation list to tokenize on ([\#86](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/86))
-   The `gtts-cli` command-line tool
    -   Rewrote cli as first-class citizen module (`gtts.cli`), powered
        by [Click](http://click.pocoo.org)
    -   Windows support using [setuptool]{.title-ref}\'s
        [entry\_points]{.title-ref}
    -   Better support for Unicode I/O in Python 2
    -   All arguments are now pre-validated
    -   New `--nocheck` flag to skip language pre-checking
    -   New `--all` flag to list all available languages
    -   Either the `--file` option or the `<text>` argument can be set
        to \"-\" to read from `stdin`
    -   The `--debug` flag uses logging and doesn\'t pollute `stdout`
        anymore

### Bugfixes

-   `_minimize()`: Fixed an infinite recursion loop that would occur
    when a token started with the miminizing delimiter (i.e. a space) ([\#86](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/86))
-   `_minimize()`: Handle the case where a token of more than 100
    characters did not contain a space (e.g. in Chinese).
-   Fixed an issue that fused multiline text together if the total
    number of characters was less than 100
-   Fixed `gtts-cli` Unicode errors in Python 2.7 (famous last words) ([\#78](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/78), [\#93](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/93), [\#96](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS/issues/96))

### Deprecations and Removals

-   Dropped Python 3.3 support
-   Removed `debug` parameter of `gTTS` (in favour of logger)
-   `gtts-cli`: Changed long option name of `-o` to `--output` instead
    of `--destination`
-   `gTTS()` will raise a `ValueError` rather than an `AssertionError`
    on unsupported language

### Improved Documentation

-   Rewrote all documentation files as reStructuredText
-   Comprehensive documentation writen for
    [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org), published to <http://gtts.readthedocs.io>
-   Changelog built with [towncrier](https://github.com/hawkowl/towncrier)

### Misc

-   Major test re-work
-   Language tests can read a `TEST_LANGS` enviromment variable so not
    all language tests are run every time.
-   Added [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com) CI for Windows
-   [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliance
